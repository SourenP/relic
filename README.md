# Relic

A multiplayer, real time, hour long race through a randomly generated dungeon with the shared goal of acquiring the highest count of relics.

## Interactive Multiplayer

All players are racing through the same dungeon and have the same goal: to collect more relics than their counterparts.
Two or more players will often find themselves in the same room. This can lead to deals, duels, chases, alliances (betrayels) and even death. In all scenarios, decisions must be made on the spot, under pressure.
This is exactly what makes the game - the 'Game of Thrones' thrill of competing for a one seat throne and doing whatever it takes to be the one who keeps it warm.

### Strategies

There are obviously many paths (pun) to victory. Here is a list of some of that come to mind off the top of my head, to giving you a feel of the game.

* Lone shark
 * Avoid interaction/coflict with other players, focus on getting as many relics as possible, as fast as possible.
* Hunter
 * Hunts down other players to steal their treasure and eliminate the competition.
* Team player
 * Two beats one. Teams up with other players to achieve efficiency and safety (until you get backstabbed).
* Rogue
 * Lurks around other players to follow the path they clear and waits for the perfect moment to strike when their weak.

## Dungeon

An arrangement of rooms that are interconnected and have a spacial flow (gradient of difficulty) from the starting point to the ending point.

Flow could be levels (floors) or a flat map.

## Relics

Tiers, each costing a different amount of points.
The grail is the most valuable relic of which there is only one.

## RPG

Loot acquirable from chests, monsters and players which you can wear (and maybe sell).
Items give stat boosts and can have special abilities.

Maybe you could only carry what you're wearing. In this case selling wouldn't be a part of the game. This dis-incentivizes killing weaker players since his/her weak items are of no value to you. Best case you'd gain a relic and destroy competition.

### Classes

Like all classic fantasy games, you can choose from a set of classes to match the strategy you plan to execute.

### Experience

Leveling up, etc.

### Items

Interesting items that come to mind:

* Wards
 * Leave behind a ward in a room that will ping you when a player enters that room.
* Tracking device
 * Track a players location for a period of time.
* Traps
 * A trap that you leave to harm other players.
* Checkpoint
 * You can teleport back to this checkpoint at any time (only one per player).
 * Maybe there is class that allows you to have several.
* Scroll of town portal
 * Saving grace, second chance, instant teleportation back to the start.

## Victory

Not sure yet.

Ideas:
* Ends when someone reaches a certain amount of points.
* Ends when the grail (super relic) is acquired.
* Time ends (meh)
* Ends when only one player left (duh).

## Death

* If you die, you lose.
* No second chances.

## Chat

Only direct messaging. You have the option to send the same message to several players but the receivers are oblivious to this (like bcc in email).

AOE has this kind of chat system and it often leads to an interesting form of team chat.
Suppose you have three players who have teamed up and need to communicate amongst each other. Ideally they would each select their corresponding two teammates while sending messages and this way everyone receives an identical chat log. But often times, players might leave one teammate out for some messages or have a fourth, secret teammate also receiving what he tells the others. This is especially useful for betrayals.

## Credits

Idea was spawned in a convesation between Hayg and Souren on their flight back home from Tokyo.
